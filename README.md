# Why ?

Private Maven repositories shouldn't cost you [an arm and a leg](https://www.cloudrepo.io/pricing.html), nor requires you to become a [Linux Sys-Admin](https://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/how-to-setup-private-maven-repository/en) to setup, and should ideally be **zero maintenance** and **costs nothing**.

Thanks to Google App-Engine's [free quotas](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas), you'll benefits for free of:

* 5GB of storage
* 1GB of daily incoming bandwidth
* 1GB of daily outgoing bandwidth
* 20,000+ storage ops per day

Moreover, no credit card is required to benefits of the quotas above.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

### Create a new Project
First of all, you'll need to go to your [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/appengine/create?lang=java&st=true) to create a new App Engine application:

As soon as your project is created, a default [Google Cloud storage bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) has been automatically created for you which provides the first 5GB of storage for free.

### Create instance in the console

Open the Console

Initialize the Project to be able to run App Engine applications. Check the available regions. 
We'll initialize the project to run in the US Central region:

```bash
$ gcloud app regions list
$ gcloud app create --region europe-west6
```


### Setup the Google Cloud SDK

Follow the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/) to install the latest Google Cloud SDK. As a shorthand, you'll find below the Ubuntu/Debian instructions:


```bash
$ export CLOUD_SDK_REPO="cloud-sdk-$(lsb_release -c -s)"
$ echo "deb http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt $CLOUD_SDK_REPO main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
$ curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk
```

Do not forget to install the `app-engine-java` [component](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/components#external_package_managers). If you installed the Google Cloud SDK using the instructions above:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk-app-engine-java
```

As a last step, configure the `gcloud` command line environment and select your newly created App Engine project when requested to do so:

```bash
$ gcloud init
$ gcloud auth application-default login
```

## Configuration

Clone (or [download](https://github.com/renaudcerrato/appengine-maven-repository/archive/master.zip)) the source code:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/renaudcerrato/appengine-maven-repository.git
```

Update [`vi src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/users.txt`] to declare users, passwords and permissions:

```ini
# That file declares your users - using basic authentication.
# Minimalistic access control is provided through the following permissions: write, read, or list.
# Syntax is:
# <username>:<password>:<permission>
# (use '*' as username and password to declare anonymous users)
admin:l33t:write
john:j123:read
donald:coolpw:read
guest:guest:list
```
> The `list` permission allows users to list the content of the repository but prohibits downloads. The `read` permission allows downloads (and implies `list`). The `write` permission allows uploads (and implies `read`).

> Anonymous users are supported by using "*" for both username and password. For example, `*:*:read` will allow anonymous read access. 

## Deployment

Once you're ready to go live, just push the application to Google App-Engine:

```bash
$ cd appengine-maven-repository
$ ./gradlew appengineDeploy
$ ./mvnw -DskipTests package appengine:deploy
```

And voil√†! Your private Maven repository is hosted and running at the following address:

`https://<your-project-id>.appspot.com`

# Usage

You'll find some usage examples in the [examples](examples) folder. There's absolutely no extra steps required to fetch and/or deploy Maven artifacts to your repository: simply use your favorite Maven tools as you're used to do. 

An example deploying artifacts using the maven plugin for Gradle:

```gradle
apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'maven'

...

uploadArchives {
    repositories {
        mavenDeployer {
            repository(url: "https://<your-project-id>.appspot.com") {
                authentication(userName: "admin", password: "s3curepa55w0rd")
            }
            pom.version = "1.0.0"
            pom.artifactId = "test"
            pom.groupId = "com.example"
        }
    }
}
```

Using the above plugin, deploying artifacts to your repository is as simple as:

```bash
$ ./gradlew upload
```

In the other way, accessing password protected Maven repositories using Gradle only requires you to specify the `credentials` closure:

```gradle
repositories {
    ...
    maven {
        credentials {
            username 'user'
            password 'YouCantGuess'
        }
        url "https://<your-project-id>.appspot.com"
    }
}
```

> Ensure you do NOT commit credentials with your code. With Gradle, you can achieve this by amending the above examples using the approach specified [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12751665/752167) of moving your creds to `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` and only referring to the variable names within your build.

# Limitations

Google App-Engine HTTP requests are limited to 32MB - and thus, any artifacts above that limit can't be hosted.

# File Management (Google Cloud File Storage)

The provided examples only provide a few gradle files that upload an installed local maven artifact. Sometimes there might be need to perform more file functions not available from gradle such as deletion.
The [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uploading-objects) includes a button that launches a browser based file browser which presents a browser interface to perform file management.
